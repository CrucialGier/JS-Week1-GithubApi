### Description

* This application was made to test our abilities to use APIs effectively and is a good example of how using APIs can gather a lot of data with just a few lines of code. This project in particular will return a github user's name, where they live, their email, a link to their profile, and a list of all of their respositories with descriptions. Just enter a username in the input and hit GO.


### Setup

* BEFORE RUNNING make sure you have nodejs installed, and npm installed globally.
https://nodejs.org/en/

* Install gulp globally using the command "$ npm install gulp -g"

* Clone the repository at
(https://github.com/CrucialGier/JS-Week1-GithubApi)
* using the command git clone

* If you want to make many requests you will need an api key from your github account. Login to github and go to your account settings. Click "Personal access tokens" then in the top right click "Generate new token". Copy the newly acquired key and paste it into the .env file in the project, between the quotes.

* Enter the Project's directory using the console and enter the commands "$ npm install", followed by "$ gulp build", and finally "$ gulp serve".

* If a webpage does not automatically open up, visit localhost:3000 in the web browser.

* To use, just enter a github username in the form and click "GO".
